		<h3>Mission</h3>
		<p>People share two pieces of information with food businesses every day: 'Who I am' and 'What I want like to eat' â€” called the Core Two. Any other information connected with a dining experience is deducible from the Core Two given The Database. For example, payment details can be extracted from The Database given the 'Who I am' piece. However, the way we order and pay for our food today involves lines, cashiers, payment terminals, and puts geo-constraints on the placement of orders. Focusing on the Core Two alone, technology can help us return to what really matters to the experience.</p> 

		<h3>Challenges</h3>
		<p>Creating a solution means atomizing the order and payment experience, and building modular solutions to each part that sum up cohesively. This is hard; the first step in facing the challenge is to understand what the problems are.</p>

		<h3>The Matching Problem</h3>
		<p>There are three entities that exist within the scope of the experience that need to be controlled and manipulated towards the end goal. These entities are (1) the customer, (2) the food, and (3) the paying identity. (In non-fraudulent cases, (1) and (3) are one and the same.) The end goal is a happy (1) costumer with (2) food, and business compensated by (3) a paying identity.</p>
		<p>The Matching Problem arises when trying to match (1) with (2), and (1) with (3). If (2) and (3) are connected together, such as in the case where the food is prepared together with a receipt for the order, the problem is reduced to matching a customer with her order. There are at least two solutions to this problem.</p>
		<p>The first has the business call out the name of the customer as is specified in the order, and allowing the order to be claimed by the responder. If we require that the customer specify her presence in the business location, we minimize the risk of a fraudulent or mistaken mismatching. </p>
		<p>The second has the customer reveal visually a unique identifier (name, number, or icon) that the business can map to the order and the food.</p>
